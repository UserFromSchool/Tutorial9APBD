# Tutorial 9 APBD
I have implemented both Task 1 and Task 2.

The First task is under
```
http://localhost:<port>/warehouse/products/add
```

The second one is under
```
http://localhost:<port>/warehouse/procedural/products/add
```

Script assumes before starting the app
a procedure was added to the database
using the console.
